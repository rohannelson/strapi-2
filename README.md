# About This Repo

This is the repo for the instance of [Strapi](https://strapi.io/) that I used for my personal website at a point.

I partly did this as a way of learning about Strapi, since I was likely going to be using it in [a work project](https://github.com/livinggracedianella/website-redesign). I also thought it might be easier to make metadata changes in a CMS rather than refactoring markdown files in an Astro repo (it was, but hey...).

I intially looked at deploying it in a docker container on [Fly.io](https://fly.io/), but then settled on deploying it via a [Render webservice](https://render.com/docs/web-services) with an attached persistent disk.

It was a helpful learning experience, and has come in handy working on the work project, but in the end I decided to switch back to vanilla Astro for my website.
